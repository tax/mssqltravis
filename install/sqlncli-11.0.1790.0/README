README for Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux

This file contains instructions and notes about the Microsoft SQL Server
ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux (hereafter called 'the driver').

* If you're reading this after being referred by the installation output,
  see 'Why is there an * in the configuration output?' in Installing below.


What's Inside
=============

This is the driver and utilities of the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 
1.0 for Linux.  The following files are included:

install.sh - The installation script to run to install the driver and its
utilities.

build_dm.sh - A helpful script used to download, configure and
build the correct version of the unixODBC Driver Manager if needed.

README - this file.

LICENSE - the license agreement for this product. Used by install.sh.

WARNING - Microsoft's 3rd party liability disclaimer.  Displayed when the
build_dm.sh script is run.

bin/bcp-11.0.1790.0 - Bulk Copy Program.  Used to import and export data
from a SQL Server table.

bin/bcp.rll - resource library that contains strings for error messages
used by BCP.  Currently only in US English (en_US).

bin/sqlcmd-11.0.1790.0 - Run SQL statements on a server.  Can be used
interactively.

bin/SQLCMD.rll - resource library that contains strings for error messages
used by sqlcmd.  Currently only in US English (en_US).

bin/BatchParserGrammar.dfa - file used by sqlcmd

bin/BatchParserGrammar.llr - file used by sqlcmd

docs/en_US.tar.gz - HTML documentation for 
Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux and its associated
utilities.

lib64/libsqlncli-11.0.so.1790.0 - Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0
for Linux

lib64/sqlnclir11.rll - resource library that contains strings for error
messages used by the driver. Currently only in US English (en_US).

Prerequisites for Installing
============================

This driver is only supported on 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 
64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Other configurations are not supported 
and will not likely work.

The following libraries must be installed for the driver to work:
glibc
e2fsprogs
krb5-libs
openssl

Most likely these libraries are installed, as they should come installed by 
default on the supported versions of RedHat Linux.

The installing user must have write privileges to the /opt directory by
default.  Otherwise, directories to place the driver and utilities may be
specified with the --bin-dir and --lib-dir options of install.sh.

This driver requires the unixODBC Driver Manager 2.3.0.  The driver manager
must be configured with the following encoding options (other options may 
also apply):

./configure --enable-iconv --with-iconv-char-enc=UTF8
  --with-iconv-ucode-enc=UTF16LE

In addition, `odbc_config --cflags` must return -DSIZEOF_LONG_INT=8 and
must NOT return -DBUILD_LEGACY_64_BIT_MODE.

Also, the installing user must have write permissions to the /usr/bin
directory if the abbreviated symbolic links to bcp-11.0.1790.0 (bcp) and
sqlcmd-11.0.1790.0 (sqlcmd) are to be installed.  Otherwise, use --force to
skip this step.

The installation script can verify most of these configuration
prerequisites by running:

./install.sh verify


What If The Driver Manager Isn't Configured Properly?
-----------------------------------------------------

You may build a properly configured unixODBC Driver Manager using the
build_dm.sh script included.  However, if this script is unable to
complete, you may configure and build the proper driver manager yourself
using the instructions below:

1. Remove any older installed version of unixODBC (for example, unixODBC
2.2.11).  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6, you can do this by executing
the following command: yum remove unixODBC.

2. Go to http://www.unixodbc.org/.

3. Click the Download link, on the left side of the page.

4. Click the Download link, on the next page, and save the file
unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz to your computer.

5. On your Linux computer, execute the following command: tar xvzf
unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz

6. Change to the unixODBC-2.3.0 directory.

7. At a command prompt, type the following command:
CPPFLAGS="-DSIZEOF_LONG_INT=8" and press enter.

8. At a command prompt, type the following command: export CPPFLAGS and
press enter.

9. At a command prompt, type the following command: "./configure
--prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --sysconfdir=/etc --enable-gui=no
--enable-drivers=no --enable-iconv --with-iconv-char-enc=UTF8
--with-iconv-ucode-enc=UTF16LE" and press enter.

10. At a command prompt (logged in as root), type the following command
'make' and press enter, and then 'make install' and press enter.

You are now ready to install the driver. See Installing the Microsoft SQL
Server ODBC Driver for Linux for more information.


Installing
==========

To install the driver once the prerequisites are assured, simply run the
installation script as follows:

./install.sh install

Options for the installation are:
  --bin-dir=<directory> - location to deposit bcp and sqlcmd utilities,
      defaults to the /opt/microsoft/sqlncli/bin directory
  --lib-dir=<directory> - location to deposit the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC 
      Driver for Linux, defaults to the /opt/microsoft/sqlncli/lib directory
  --force - continues installation even if an error occurs
  --accept-license - forgoes showing the EULA and implies agreement with its 
                     contents

A successful installation will complete as follows:

Checking for 64 bit Linux compatible OS ..................................... OK
Checking required libs are installed ........................................ OK
unixODBC utilities (odbc_config and odbcinst) installed ..................... OK
unixODBC Driver Manager version 2.3.0 installed ............................. OK
unixODBC Driver Manager configuration correct .............................. OK*
Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux already installed .... NOT FOUND
Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux files copied ................ OK
Symbolic links for bcp and sqlcmd created ................................... OK
Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux registered ........... INSTALLED

Any problems are reported in the log file, the path to which is printed at
the end of the installation.


Why is there an * in the configuration output?
----------------------------------------------

The installation script will attempt to verify the configuration of the
system before installing the driver.  However, the character encoding used by
the unixODBC Driver Manager cannot be verified through its included utilities.
If you are not sure of the encoding that the unixODBC 2.3.0 Driver Manager was
built with, check with your system administrator.  If the encoding still cannot
be verified, you might need to build and install a new copy.  See 'What If The
Driver Manager Isn't Configured Properly?' above.
